# Advanced-Sentiment-Analysis
PYTHON( Visual Studio Code ), SQL( SSMS ), EXCEL( CSV )
## Purpose
  This project demonstrates how to perform advanced sentiment analysis using Python, SQL, and various libraries like nltk, pyodbc, and vaderSentiment. It connects to a SQL database to fetch text data, performs sentiment analysis on the data, and categorizes the sentiment score into predefined buckets.

## Requirements
  - Python libraries installed:
    -pandas
    -nltk
    -pyodbc
    -sqlalchemy
    -vaderSentiment

## Steps 
1. **Import pandas, nltk, pyodbc, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer**
   
- `pandas`
- `nltk`
- `pyodbc`
- `sqlalchemy`

2. **Dowload vader_lexicon (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) required for sentiment analysis.**
   
    - `vaderSentiment`
      
3. **Fetch Data from SQL Database**
   
   - Create a function to fetch data from your SQL database using `pyodbc` and `pandas.read_sql()`
   
4. **Perform Sentiment Analysis**

   - Use the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` from `nltk` to calculate sentiment scores.
   
5. **Categorize Sentiment Based on Score**

   - Define categories based on sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative).
   
6. **Bucket Sentiment Scores**

   - Create a function that buckets sentiment scores into predefined text categories.
   
7. **Apply Sentiment Analysis**
   
   -Apply the sentiment analysis function on the dataset to get sentiment scores.
   
8. **Apply Sentiment Categorization**

   - Apply the categorization function to the sentiment scores.
   
9. **Apply Bucketing**

   -Apply the bucketing function on the sentiment scores.
  
10. **Save to CSV File**
  
   - Save the results into a CSV file.

## Results & Insights
  - Reviews are categorized into Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed Positive, and Mixed Negative.
  - Sentiment scores are grouped into specific score buckets for further analysis.
  - The output data can be used to enhance marketing strategies, identify product issues, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Future Enhancements
  - ✅ Incorporate machine learning models for sentiment analysis
  - ✅ Use topic modeling to extract common themes in reviews
  - ✅ Implement real-time sentiment analysis for dynamic insights

## Conclusion

This project enables automated sentiment analysis on large text datasets by integrating Python with SQL, and it categorizes sentiments into predefined buckets for better understanding of the data. The output is saved in a CSV format for further use or reporting.
